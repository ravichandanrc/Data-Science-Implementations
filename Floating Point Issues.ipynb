    "After running the loop for 100 iterations, the exact sum can be observed at 11 numbers that are printed (0,1,3,4,5,6,11,12,43,44,45).\n",
    "Running the loop for 10,100,1000 iterations, it can be observed that sum decreased while the error increased.\n",
    "In case of part 2, after numerous trials - it can be deduced that the difference ('diff') is closest to 0.1 at 9998 iterations.\n",
    "i.e atleast 9998 iterations would be needed to have an error that is as large as the number we add (0.1 in this case).\n",

    "Two numbers between 0 and 1 which have incorrect results for 100 iterations : 0.2, 0.3\n",
    "While assigning the numbers like 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, etc, it can be observed that the correct results are not obtained as they are\n",
    "represented in binary format.\n",
    "The number is rounded to the the nearest integer in binary 64 format.\n",
    "However, few numbers are exactly represented as floating point numbers.\n",
    "Numbers like 0.25,0.5, 0.75 (my observations) do not have this issue as they are represented exactly as\n",
    "floating point numbers, being in the same format in binary64 and decimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the decimal package, we can observe that the value of 'sum' increases slightly while 'diff_f' margin decreases.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we increase iterations, the value of sum decreases for regular floating point values while for for decimals, it does not.\n",
    "Also, the difference increases for regular floating point values while for decimals, it does not.\n",
    "Decimal package deals with nuumbers like how arithmetic is taught in school.\n",
    "Unlike floats, Python represents decimal numbers exactly. And the exactness carries over into arithmetic."
