    "\n",
    "When running the code for multiple matrix sizes from 10 to 500, the following results are obtained.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the matrix size is 10, the elapsed time is less than a second.\n",
    "When the matrix size is 100, the time elapsed is close to 0.28 seconds.\n",
    "When the matrix size is 500, the elapsed time increased rapidly taking it to 33.64 seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see from the above observations, time needed for computation per element increases as the matrix size increases.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "After including @profile right above the function definition, the results can be compared to part 1 as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "When the matrix size is 10, the elapsed time is less than a second.\n",
    "When the matrix size is 50, the elapsed time is 7.11 seconds.\n",

    "By analyzing memory usage line-by-line, the Profiler can show where code is consuming more memory, which changes the runtime. When the Profiler attempts to report\n",
    "the line-by-line amount and it finds duplicate lines, it discovers loops implicitly. Even though the time of execution is more in profiling,\n",
    "it optimises the function calls using comparatively lower resources. "
